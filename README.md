# React To-Do App

A simple to-do list application to demonstrate my React knowledge.

Front-end project only, no backend or database storage.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and `cd` into its root directory
2. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
3. Run `yarn start` from the project directory to run in development mode

The application is served at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default.

## Building

Run `yarn build` to build the static assets for external or local hosting. The files will be located inside the `build` folder by default.

This correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.

## Testing

1. Run `yarn start` to run in development mode
2. Run `yarn cypress:run` to run end-to-end tests
