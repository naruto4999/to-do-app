# React To-Do App

A simple to-do list application to demonstrate my React knowledge.

Front-end project only, no backend or database storage.

## Serving

Run `npm start` from the project directory to run in development mode.

The application is served at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default.

## Building

Run `npm build` to build the static assets for external or local hosting. The files will be located inside the `build` folder by default.

This correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.
